def icap(X, y, **kwargs):
    """
    This function implements the ICAP feature selection.
    When used with SelectKBest, it returns scores and None for p-values.
    When used directly with mode parameter, it returns additional information.

    Input
    -----
    X: {numpy array}, shape (n_samples, n_features)
        input data, guaranteed to be a discrete data matrix
    y: {numpy array}, shape (n_samples,)
        input class labels
    kwargs: {dictionary}
        mode: {"rank", "index", None}, default="rank"
            If None, return scores and None for p-values (used with SelectKBest)
            If "rank" or "index", return additional information
        n_selected_features: {int}
            number of features to select

    Output
    ------
    When mode is None (used with SelectKBest):
        scores: {numpy array}, shape (n_features,)
            scores for each feature
        p_values: None

    When mode is specified:
        F: {numpy array}, shape (n_features,)
            index of selected features, F[0] is the most important feature
        J_ICAP: {numpy array}, shape: (n_features,)
            corresponding objective function value of selected features
        MIfy: {numpy array}, shape: (n_features,)
            corresponding mutual information between selected features and response
